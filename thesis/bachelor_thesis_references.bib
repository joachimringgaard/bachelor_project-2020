abstract = {Recognizing arbitrary multi-character text in unconstrained natural photographs is a hard problem. In this paper, we address an equally hard sub-problem in this domain viz. recognizing arbitrary multi-digit numbers from Street View imagery. Traditional approaches to solve this problem typically separate out the localization, segmentation, and recognition steps. In this paper we propose a unified approach that integrates these three steps via the use of a deep convolutional neural network that operates directly on the image pixels. We employ the DistBelief (Dean et al., 2012) implementation of deep neural networks in order to train large, distributed neural networks on high quality images. We find that the performance of this approach increases with the depth of the convolutional network, with the best performance occurring in the deepest architecture we trained, with eleven hidden layers. We evaluate this approach on the publicly available SVHN dataset and achieve over 96{\%} accuracy in recognizing complete street numbers. We show that on a per-digit recognition task, we improve upon the state-of-the-art, achieving 97.84{\%} accuracy. We also evaluate this approach on an even more challenging dataset generated from Street View imagery containing several tens of millions of street number annotations and achieve over 90{\%} accuracy. To further explore the applicability of the proposed system to broader text recognition tasks, we apply it to transcribing synthetic distorted text from a popular CAPTCHA service, reCAPTCHA. reCAPTCHA is one of the most secure reverse turing tests that uses distorted text as one of the cues to distinguish humans from bots. With the proposed approach we report a 99.8{\%} accuracy on transcribing the hardest category of reCAPTCHA puzzles. Our evaluations on both tasks, the street number recognition as well as reCAPTCHA puzzle transcription, indicate that at specific operating thresholds, the performance of the proposed system is comparable to, and in some cases exceeds, that of human operators.},

abstract = {With growing interest in adversarial machine learning, it is important for machine learning practitioners and users to understand how their models may be attacked. We propose a web-based visualization tool, Adversarial-Playground, to demonstrate the efficacy of common adversarial methods against a deep neural network (DNN) model, built on top of the TensorFlow library. Adversarial-Playground provides users an efficient and effective experience in exploring techniques generating adversarial examples, which are inputs crafted by an adversary to fool a machine learning system. To enable Adversarial-Playground to generate quick and accurate responses for users, we use two primary tactics: (1) We propose a faster variant of the state-of-the-art Jacobian saliency map approach that maintains a comparable evasion rate. (2) Our visualization does not transmit the generated adversarial images to the client, but rather only the matrix describing the sample and the vector representing classification likelihoods. The source code along with the data from all of our experiments are available at $\backslash$url{\{}https://github.com/QData/AdversarialDNN-Playground{\}}.},

@book{Khan2018,
abstract = {Computer vision has become increasingly important and effective in recent years due to its wide-ranging applications in areas as diverse as smart surveillance and monitoring, health and medicine, sports and recreation, robotics, drones, and self-driving cars. Visual recognition tasks, such as image classification, localization, and detection, are the core building blocks of many of these applications, and recent developments in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have led to outstanding performance in these state-of-the-art visual recognition tasks and systems. As a result, CNNs now form the crux of deep learning algorithms in computer vision. is self-contained guide will benefit those who seek to both understand the theory be- hind CNNs and to gain hands-on experience on the application of CNNs in computer vision. It provides a comprehensive introduction to CNNs starting with the essential concepts behind neural networks: training, regularization, and optimization of CNNs. e book also discusses a wide range of loss functions, network layers, and popular CNN architectures, reviews the differ- ent techniques for the evaluation of CNNs, and presents some popular CNN tools and libraries that are commonly used in computer vision. Further, this text describes and discusses case stud- ies that are related to the application of CNN in computer vision, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, scene understanding, and image generation. is book is ideal for undergraduate and graduate students, as no prior background knowl- edge in the field is required to follow the material, as well as new researchers, developers, engi- neers, and practitioners who are interested in gaining a quick understanding of CNN models.},

abstract = {Deep Learning methods are currently the state-of-the-art in many Computer Vision and Image Processing problems, in particular image classification. After years of intensive investigation, a few models matured and became important tools, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Siamese and Triplet Networks, Auto-Encoders (AEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The field is fast-paced and there is a lot of terminologies to catch up for those who want to adventure in Deep Learning waters. This paper has the objective to introduce the most fundamental concepts of Deep Learning for Computer Vision in particular CNNs, AEs and GANs, including architectures, inner workings and optimization. We offer an updated description of the theoretical and practical knowledge of working with those models. After that, we describe Siamese and Triplet Networks, not often covered in tutorial papers, as well as review the literature on recent and exciting topics such as visual stylization, pixel-wise prediction and video processing. Finally, we discuss the limitations of Deep Learning for Computer Vision.},

@article{Akhtar2018,
abstract = {Deep learning is at the heart of the current rise of artificial intelligence. In the field of computer vision, it has become the workhorse for applications ranging from self-driving cars to surveillance and security. Whereas, deep neural networks have demonstrated phenomenal success (often beyond human capabilities) in solving complex problems, recent studies show that they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks in the form of subtle perturbations to inputs that lead a model to predict incorrect outputs. For images, such perturbations are often too small to be perceptible, yet they completely fool the deep learning models. Adversarial attacks pose a serious threat to the success of deep learning in practice. This fact has recently led to a large influx of contributions in this direction. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey on adversarial attacks on deep learning in computer vision. We review the works that design adversarial attacks, analyze the existence of such attacks and propose defenses against them. To emphasize that adversarial attacks are possible in practical conditions, we separately review the contributions that evaluate adversarial attacks in the real-world scenarios. Finally, drawing on the reviewed literature, we provide a broader outlook of this research direction.},
